				To reach somewhere, you’ve to leave. If you don’t do so at the right time, you’ll get attached. <br>
				Sometimes some past moments open up so many windows of our memories that we experience awe. <br>
				I want to fly, and run. I am not even afraid of falling down. I just don’t want to stop! <br>
				Memories are like a box of sweets. Once it opens, you won’t be able to stop by tasting just one piece. <br>
				Time doesn’t stop, it passes and it’s actually us, who get spend <br>
